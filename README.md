SkyTrack Solutions
My capstone project will be focused on the travel industry, developing an Airline Operations
Dashboard where I will leverage my background in process efficiency, project management, and
software implementation. This dashboard would be designed for internal airline use to streamline
and enhance operational efficiency in areas like inventory control, maintenance scheduling, and
flight crew management.
Project Idea: Airline Operations Dashboard
Key Features:

1. Inventory and Equipment Management:
◦ Track and manage airplane parts, tools, and other resources.
◦ Implement alerts for low stock levels or maintenance schedules.
◦ Integration with real-time inventory control systems.
3. Flight Crew Management:
◦ Create schedules for pilots, flight attendants, and ground staff.
◦ Include real-time updates on delays, cancellations, or shift changes.
◦ Track certifications and training records to ensure crew compliance.
4. Maintenance Scheduling and Tracking:
◦ Schedule routine maintenance and track repairs for each aircraft.
◦ Automate maintenance due date alerts based on flight hours or time since last
service.
◦ Provide a dashboard for maintenance staff to log work completed.
5. Flight Status and Operations Monitoring:
◦ Real-time monitoring of flight status (delays, on-time, etc.).
◦ Overview of operational efficiency for flight turnarounds, passenger handling, and
baggage handling.

Technologies:

• Frontend: Use React or Angular to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

◦ React/Angular would allow for real-time updates and smooth transitions between
  different operational views.

• Backend: Use PHP to handle server-side logic.

◦ PHP could manage APIs for integrating with existing airline systems (e.g.,
  inventory, flight databases).

• Database: Implement a MySQL or PostgreSQL database for storing and managing
  inventory, schedules, and flight/crew data.

Implementation Plan:

1. Research and Planning:
◦ Gather insights from airline operations and identify key areas where efficiency
improvements are most needed.
2. System Design:
◦ Use React/Angular to build modular components for inventory tracking, flight
crew scheduling, and real-time flight monitoring.
◦ Create a PHP backend for API handling and data processing.
3. Development:
◦ Implement the core features and ensure that the system integrates with airline
systems (or simulate these integrations for the capstone).
4. Testing and Optimization:
◦ Test the application with sample data and optimize the UX for operational staff.
